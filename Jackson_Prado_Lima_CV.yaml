    summary:
      - "I sit at the rare intersection where Executive Strategy meets Ph.D. Rigor and Production-Grade Engineering. As a **Hands-on Chief of Technology**, I manage a distributed army of 50+ engineers and specialize in turning distressed technical environments into scalable, profitable engines - such as slashing a client's cloud costs by 85% ($720k/year savings). I am Technology Agnostic: I view languages as means to an end. Whether the solution requires Rust, Go, Python, or a legacy stack, I adapt immediately. My core skill is rapid technology acquisition to solve business problems."
      - "Simultaneously, I am an active **Professor and Researcher**. Beyond holding a Ph.D. in Software Engineering & AI, I spearhead strategic R&D initiatives, recently architecting the CYPHER project - a high-performance Cyber-Physical Systems center designed for NVIDIA H200 clusters and robotics. My mandate is efficiency in both worlds: I leverage cutting-edge Evolutionary Algorithms and LLMs to solve business problems, bridging the gap between boardroom goals and server-room reality."
